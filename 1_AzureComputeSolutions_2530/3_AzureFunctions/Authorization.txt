In Azure Functions, authorization levels are used to control access to your serverless 
functions. They determine the level of authentication required for invoking a function. The following are the available authorization levels in Azure Functions:

Anonymous: Functions with the "Anonymous" authorization level can be 
accessed by anyone without any authentication. This level is suitable 
for functions that are intended to be publicly accessible and do not 
require any user identity.

Function: Functions with the "Function" authorization level require 
a valid function key to invoke them. A function key is a code that is generated by Azure Functions and acts as a shared secret between the client and the function. It provides a level of security by ensuring that only clients with a valid function key can invoke the function.

Admin: Functions with the "Admin" authorization level can only be invoked 
by clients with the host-level authorization key. The host-level key is a 
special key that provides administrative access to all functions
 within an Azure Functions host. It is typically used for administrative 
 tasks and should be kept secure.

System: The "System" authorization level is reserved for internal 
use by Azure Functions. It is used for system-level operations 
and should not be used for regular function access.

By default, Azure Functions are secured using the function key-based authentication model.
However, you can also configure additional authentication mechanisms such as 
Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication or OAuth providers to secure your functions.
